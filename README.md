# AlfaLens

This project was developed while I was working at ViralStudios.

It is made with the 2018.4 version of Unity.

Developed for the Microsoft HoloLens 1 device, and using Vuforia for recognizing 3D real world objects and showing holograms dedicated
to teaching the medical operation process, and information related, to patients that suffer from colorectal cancer.
